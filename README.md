- Yo, I’m @TheDeadRisin
- I just recently started programming and slowly but surely I'm trying to get the hang of it.
- Why did I start programming? Dunno either, I installed VS-Code and got myself into Python. A friend helps me to comprehend the language.
- Any notable projects? None... **yet**.
- Anything notable about me? None aswell, except you see my bipolar depression as something important... :)
